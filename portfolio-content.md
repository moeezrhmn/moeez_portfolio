## About / Summary

I'm a Backend Engineer specializing in Python (FastAPI, Flask) and Laravel, focused on building reliable APIs, automation workflows, and backend systems for SaaS and AI-powered products.

I'm not a generalist — I'm strongest where companies feel the most pain: systems that move data, integrate platforms, automate operations, and scale without breaking.

### What I do best
- API design & backend architecture
- Third-party integrations (Shopify, eBay, custom APIs, legacy systems)
- Automation workflows that replace hours of manual work
- E-commerce backend systems & operational tooling
- Building internal tools for order, inventory, and data processing

### Notable work
- Synced 300k+ products across Shopify & eBay and automated 40+ daily orders, including UK Royal Mail label generation
- Built SaaS-style internal tools for order + inventory workflows
- Connected multiple external services into unified systems, replacing slow/fragmented manual processes
- Delivered automation workflows that saved teams hundreds of hours per month

### Tech I work with
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI, Flask, Django) • PHP - Laravel • PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Integrations:** Shopify API • eBay API • REST integrations • Multiple platforms
- **Systems:** Automation pipelines • SaaS backends
- **Frontend:** Working knowledge of Vue.js / React for integration layers

### What I'm looking for
Roles or projects that involve backend engineering, automations, integrations, SaaS systems, or AI-powered workflows — remote or onsite.

If you're building something serious and need a backend engineer who can ship clean, dependable systems, let's talk.
